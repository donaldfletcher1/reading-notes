# Comparison operators
## **Assignment operator** assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

##Name	Shorthand operator	Meaning
1. Assignment	x = f()	x = f()
2. Addition assignment	x += f()	x = x + f()
3. Subtraction assignment	x -= f()	x = x - f()
4. Multiplication assignment	x *= f()	x = x * f()
5. Division assignment	x /= f()	x = x / f()
6. Remainder assignment	x %= f()	x = x % f()
7. Exponentiation assignment	x **= f()	x = x ** f()

#Assignment operators

Equal (==)	Returns true if the operands are equal.	

Not equal (!=)	Returns true if the operands are not equal.

Strict equal (===)	Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. 

Strict not equal (!==)	Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.

Greater than (>)	Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.	

Greater than or equal (>=)	Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

Less than (<)	Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.

Less than or equal (<=)	Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
# Loops
## **For loop**
For loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
for (Initialexpression);(conditionExpression);(incrementexpression)
for (let i = 0;) i <countDownToNewYears 10;(i++){}

## **While loop**
While loop executes its statements as long as condition evaluates to true
while(condition)
statement
If the condition becomes false,statement within the loop stops executing.
