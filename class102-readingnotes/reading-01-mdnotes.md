# Markdown syntax
## Mardown applications support the basic syntax outlined in design doc

### Every heading in Markdown begins with hash sign
### The number of hash signs you use show the heading level
### *To create paragraphs you use a blank line to separate one or more lines*
### To create bold lines you use ** bold text **
### Italicized text is * Italicized *
### To create block quote add a > in front of a paragraph
### To create ordered list add line items with numbers followed by periods.
### Unordered list just add a  -,*, or + in front of items, **cannot mix & match**
