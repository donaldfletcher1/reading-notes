# Programming with javascript
### Control flow is the order the computer executes statements in a script
### Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line unless the computer runs across conditionals and loops.
### Typical scripts in javascript include many structures, like conditionals,loops and functions.

# JavaScript Functions
### A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a task
### A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it(calls it)

## A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ()

### Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables)
### The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
### Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
### Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
### Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.
### The () Operator Invokes the Function
